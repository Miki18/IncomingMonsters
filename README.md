# IncomingMonsters

<strong>Hi!</strong>
This is a simple c++ OpenGL game.

<strong>Game rules:</strong>
Monsters incoming and you have to shoot them. You they step on red line - you will lose one of your 3 lives.
For killing monsters you will get money, so you will be able to buy some upgrades for your cannon.

If you want to see it at work here is a gameplay:
